# HR-Emp-Attrition-Analysis

I employed Power BI to generate an interactive four-page report that provides insights into employee attrition
within the company.

This report includes data on the number of employees who have left the company, categorized by gender, as well
as the distribution of employees by department and gender. Additionally, it offers information on the best and
lowest-performing employees, their marital status, job reviews, and job satisfaction levels
